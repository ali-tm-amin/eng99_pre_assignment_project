## Project summary
Creating multi-node k8 cluster on AWS to run a web app that is fully functional for customers to use. This app has to be highly available and highly scalable so that if we have high traffic we can cater for it and also available in different availability zone in case anything happens to one of the availability zones we have a load balancer that diverts traffic to the healthy instances. 

we need to use an s3 bucket for a disaster recovery plan. 
we need to monitor it with cloud watch and grfana.

node app with MongoDB
create 3 instances for the web app and 
3 instances for MongoDB
